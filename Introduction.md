My name is Mario Mena. So far I have taken CS 1, 2 and 3, Embedded Linux, Web Development, Software Engineering, Assembly, Operating Systems, and Object Oriented Programming. As for programming languages I’ve only worked with java and python.
I see myself using what I learn in class for other class projects and out in the real world. I’ve been told that web programming is very popular these days so it’ll definitely come in handy to know this.
